**Intial Project Ideas**

#####Feedback from Community; Short blurb at high level

Three potential ideas for Capstone Projects(Titles and Blurbs):

**Project 1. Merck Molecular Activity Challenge** - [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity)


- Background: When developing new medicines it is important to identify molecules that are highly active toward their intended targets but not toward other targets that might cause side effects. 

- The Aim:  To identify the best statistical techniques for predicting biological activities of different molecules, both on- and off-target, given numerical descriptors generated from their chemical structures. 
      
- Data: [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/MerckActivity/data) consist of 15 biological activity data sets in comma separated value (CSV) format. Each row of data corresponds to a chemical structure represented by molecular descriptors.


**Project 2. Home Depot Product Search Relevance** - [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance)


- Background: Shoppers rely on Home Depot’s product authority to find and buy the latest products and to get timely solutions to their home improvement needs. From installing a new ceiling fan to remodeling an entire kitchen, with the click of a mouse or tap of the screen, customers expect the correct results to their queries – quickly. Speed, accuracy and delivering a frictionless customer experience are essential. 

- The Aim:  Improve Home Depot customers' shopping experience by developing a model that can accurately predict the relevance of search results. 
      
- Data: [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance/data) contains a number of products and real customer search terms from Home Depot's website. The challenge is to predict a relevance score for the provided combinations of search terms and products. To create the ground truth labels, Home Depot has crowdsourced the search/product pairs to multiple human raters. 



**Project 3. Homesite Quote Conversion** - [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/homesite-quote-conversion)

- Background: Before asking someone on a date or skydiving, it's important to know your likelihood of success. The same goes for quoting home insurance prices to a potential customer. Homesite, a leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not currently have a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase. 

- The Aim: Predicting which customers will purchase a given quote. Accurately predicting conversion would help Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintain an ideal portfolio of customer segments. 

- Data: [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/homesite-quote-conversion/data)  represents the activity of a large number of customers who are interested in buying policies from Homesite. Each QuoteNumber corresponds to a potential customer and the QuoteConversion_Flag indicates whether the customer purchased a policy. 




My preference would be project 1,2 then 3.
