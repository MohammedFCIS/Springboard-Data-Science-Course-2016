**Intial Project Ideas**

#####Feedback from Community; Short blurb at high level

Three potential ideas for Capstone Projects(Titles and Blurbs):

**Project 1. Home Depot Product Search Relevance** - [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance)


- Background: Shoppers rely on Home Depot’s product authority to find and buy the latest products and to get timely solutions to their home improvement needs. From installing a new ceiling fan to remodeling an entire kitchen, with the click of a mouse or tap of the screen, customers expect the correct results to their queries – quickly. Speed, accuracy and delivering a frictionless customer experience are essential. 

- The Aim:  Improve Home Depot customers' shopping experience by developing a model that can accurately predict the relevance of search results. 
      
- Data: [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance/data) contains a number of products and real customer search terms from Home Depot's website. The challenge is to predict a relevance score for the provided combinations of search terms and products. To create the ground truth labels, Home Depot has crowdsourced the search/product pairs to multiple human raters. 



**Project 2. Homesite Quote Conversion** - [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/homesite-quote-conversion)

- Background: Before asking someone on a date or skydiving, it's important to know your likelihood of success. The same goes for quoting home insurance prices to a potential customer. Homesite, a leading provider of homeowners insurance, does not currently have a dynamic conversion rate model that can give them confidence a quoted price will lead to a purchase. 

- The Aim: Predicting which customers will purchase a given quote. Accurately predicting conversion would help Homesite better understand the impact of proposed pricing changes and maintain an ideal portfolio of customer segments. 

- Data: [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/homesite-quote-conversion/data)  represents the activity of a large number of customers who are interested in buying policies from Homesite. Each QuoteNumber corresponds to a potential customer and the QuoteConversion_Flag indicates whether the customer purchased a policy. 

**Project 3. Airbnb New User Bookings** - [Kaggle Competitions] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings)

- Background: nstead of waking to overlooked "Do not disturb" signs, Airbnb travelers find themselves rising with the birds in a whimsical treehouse, having their morning coffee on the deck of a houseboat, or cooking a shared regional breakfast with their hosts. 

	New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.  

- The Aim: Predicting in which country a new user will make his or her first booking. Kagglers who impress with their answer (and an explanation of how they got there).
	
	
- Data: [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data) is  a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. You are asked to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. All the users in this dataset are from the USA.




My preference would be project 1.
